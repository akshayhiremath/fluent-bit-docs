## Stable

For production systems, we strongly suggest that you always get the latest stable release from our web site, you can get the official tarballs \(.tar.gz\) from using the following link pattern:

https://fluentbit.io/release/1.7/fluent-bit-&lt;release version&gt;. For example for version 1.7.4 the link is the following: [https://fluentbit.io/releases/1.7/fluent-bit-1.7.4.tar.gz](https://fluentbit.io/releases/1.7/fluent-bit-1.7.4.tar.gz)

## Development

For people who aims to contribute to the project testing or extending the code base, can get the development version from our GIT repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit
```

Note that our _master_ branch is where the development of Fluent Bit happens. Since it's a development version, expect issues when compiling or at run time.

We encourage everybody to help us testing every development version, at the end this is what will become stable.
